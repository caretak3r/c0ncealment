# c0ncealment

_This is a way to conceal one's self against oppressive `eyes`._

Heh, this is just a handy place to take care of one's privacy issues.

####todo:
	- add killswitch options
	- check leaky subjects
	- multi-hop as a part of the concealment
	- _post-quantum resistance_ by using pre-shared keys per peer
		- peer can be a DNS server
		- peer can be a C2
		- peer can be a client
